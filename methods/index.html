                    <span>Preparation:</span><br>
                    To infuse your brew with rich, aromatic flavours, prepare 12-14 grams of medium to fine-ground

                    <span>Temperature Check:</span><br>
                    Heat 200ml of water to 80-85 degrees Celsius, the sweet spot for extracting the nuanced flavours of
                    your
                    coffee. The correct temperature is critical to unlocking the full potential of your brew. Stir and
                    Steep:
                    Stir the grounds and water together for 10 seconds, allowing them to mingle and infuse. Let your
                    concoction
                    steep for 1-2 minutes, ensuring a perfect balance of flavours.<br><br>

                    <span>Press and Pour:</span><br>
                    Apply gentle pressure to the plunger for approximately 30 seconds, ensuring a smooth and seamless
                    extraction. Then, delight in the pour as your coffee cascades into your waiting cup.<br><br>

                    <span>Savour:</span><br>
                    Take a moment to appreciate the fruits of your labour as you enjoy a cup of coffee crafted with
                    precision
                    and care. Allow the flavours to dance across your palate, leaving you longing for another sip. This

                    <span>Steeping and Pouring:</span><br>
                    In three even batches, pour the remaining water into the Chemex, reaching a total
                    volume of 400ml. With each pour, please don't disturb the delicate coffee grounds, allowing them to
                    work
                    their magic undisturbed.<br><br>

                    <span>Enjoy:</span><br>
                    As the last drops of coffee find their way into your Chemex, take a moment to appreciate the
                    elegance and simplicity of the brewing process. Pour yourself a cup and savour the smooth, clean
                    flavours that only a Chemex can deliver.

                    <!-- Moka Pot Brew Method: Unlocking Intensity in Every Drop -->
                    <span>Fill and Assemble:</span><br>
                    Begin by filling the water chamber of your Moka Pot with water, ensuring it's below
                    the release valve. Next, fill the basket with medium-fine ground coffee, ready to infuse your brew
                    with
                    bold flavours.<br><br>

                    <span>Seal and Heat:</span><br>
                    Assemble your Moka Pot, ensuring the seal is clean and secure. Place it on a medium heat
                    source and allow the magic to begin.<br><br>

                    <span>Brewing Magic:</span><br>
                    As the water begins to boil, watch as your Moka Pot works its magic, slowly extracting
                    the intense flavours of the coffee grounds. Watch as the coffee fills the top chamber, adjusting the
                    heat to achieve the perfect extraction.<br><br>

                    <span>Serve and Enjoy:</span><br>
                    Once the top chamber is filled to about 80%, remove the Moka Pot from the heat and pour
                    yourself a cup of pure caffeinated bliss. Take a moment to savour the intensity of flavour that only
                    a
                    Moka Pot can deliver.

                    <!-- Siphon Brew Method: Unveiling Elegance in Every Sip -->
                    <span>Setup:</span><br>
                    Set up your clean siphon equipment over a burner, ready to work its magic. Fill the bottom globe
                    with water, resting the top globe on top in preparation for brewing.<br><br>

                    <span>Heat and Prepare:</span><br>
                    Heat your water to the perfect temperature, aiming for around 92 degrees Celsius. As
                    the water begins to boil, fit the top globe tightly to the bottom globe, allowing the water to
                    transfer
                    to the top.<br><br>

                    <span>Coffee Addition:</span><br>
                    Once the water has transferred to the top globe, add your desired fine to medium-ground
                    coffee to the top chamber. Stir gently to ensure even saturation, then allow the coffee to steep for
                    3
                    minutes.<br><br>

                    <span>Extraction:</span><br>
                    After steeping, remove the heat source carefully until the filtered coffee returns to the
                    bottom globe. Once complete, carefully remove the top globe and pour yourself a cup of pure
                    siphon-brewed perfection.
